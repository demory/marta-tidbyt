MARTA Tidbyt App

Shows arrival times in minutes for up to 4 next trains at a specific station.

Currently hardcoded for Midtown station. Update line 10 in `marta.star` to change station. Station name must exactly match spelling/formatting of name in REST API.

TODO:
- Make station configurable
- Pagination option for for showing more than 4 trains? 
- Make available as Tidbyt community app
